# What is Project/Problem-Based Learning

## Project-based Learning (PjBL)

## Problem-Based Learning (PBL)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

# Motivation - Why am I using Projects and Problems?
- Students expect a hands-on engineering experience
- We, _professors_, give them an analytical background

# Motivation - Why am I using Projects and Problems?
## Most important ABET outcomes ranked by practicing engineers, employers, and recent graduates 
### 1. problem solving 
Students need practice solving problems
### 2. communication
Students need to share results e.g. improve technical writing

- Engineering expecations
    - analytical <- what we give them
    - empirical <- what students come for 
    - combine with Jupyter notebooks
- Project- vs Problem-based Learning
    - PjBL:
    - PBL:
- Criteria-based grading
    - All reports graded Pass/Fail (7 passes = A, 6 passes = A-, ...)
    - Students encouraged to "Fail" and revise with tokens
    - Detailed rubric gave 7 TAs consistent scheme
    - 
- Demonstrate understanding with technical writing
    - necessary skill in engineering + other careers
    - _needs_ practice in engineering courses (not humanities)
- Methods:
    - 5 PBL labs with content in Jupyter
    - 1 PjBL lab open-ended with definite goal
    - assess technical writing improvements
    - survey students for most important skills
    - survey students for capstone preparedness
    - measure total error in student Project predictions
- Results
    - Tech writing improved
    - students agreed that tech writing was one of the most important skills
    - Students felt  more prepared for capstone project
- Conclusion and next steps
    - Students need opportunities for PBL and PjBL in every class
        - it improves tech writing
        - it connects empirical and analytical methods
    - Jupyter is an _awesome_ way to build open educational resources
        - connects empirical to analytical methods
        - interactive materials encourage experimentation and exploration
        - free and __open__: you can download/modify/redistribute _great for building student portfolios_
    - Critera-based grading is first step to _my ungrading journey_
        - >80% of students liked the system
        - the failing cases were a mix of apathetic and enraged
        -
